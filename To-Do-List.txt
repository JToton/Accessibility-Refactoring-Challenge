# Notes from TA's:
- Organize by: root element - elements <a <div for styling - classes - Id's - then media queries

# To-do list:

. Fix the broken link at the top
    -add reference that matches other two functioning links

. Add Semantic Elements to index.html
    -refactor labels and divs, organize better.
    -have css reflect changes, lavels and organization.

. Organize css style sheet
    -order the styling sections to match the website flow top down
    -there shouldn't be sections that affect the middle images at the bottom
    after the aside elements near the footer...etc...

. Check css for un-needed code.
    -There may be sections that are redundant, verify all are needed.

. Add Alt Elements for accessiblities
    -Add Accessibility Features
    -If possible, download and use a Accessibility browser type or 
    software to confirm all additions are functioning.
